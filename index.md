## About Me

Greetings and thanks for visiting my homepage. 

My name is Yanlin Li. I am a Master of Computing (Artificial Intelligence specialization) student at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) from August 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Mong-Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and [Prof. Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and [Dr. Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/). Before that, I have obtained the Bachelor of Software Engineering at the [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China.
