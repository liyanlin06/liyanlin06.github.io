## About Me

Greetings and thanks for visiting my homepage. 

My name is Yanlin Li. I am a Master of Computing (Artificial Intelligence specialization) student at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) from August 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Mong-Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and [Prof. Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and [Dr. Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/). Before that, I have obtained the Bachelor of Software Engineering at the [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China.

I am actively looking for <font color='red'>Ph.D</font> position in 2026 Spring or 2026 Fall. I am eager to explore novel areas of research (current attempts are to define future directions) and I am also willing to seek some external collaborations. Contact me if you have any leads! Deeply obliged.

## Research Interests


I believe that the development of technology should always be human-centered, and my long-term research goal is to build **Human-Centered AI System**.

For example, people should be able to use AI tools to achieve their own purposes in natural and intuitive ways—such as generating a personalized, aesthetically enhanced portrait from an ID photo, just as the image on my homepage illustrates. (BTW, if you would like to see my unedited ID photo, please refer to my Google Scholar.)

To advance this vision, I focus on three interconnected aspects:

- **Interaction**: Only with natural and intuitive multimodal interaction can AI truly align with human habits, providing personalized and collaborative experiences.
- **Cognition**: Only by understanding and simulating human cognitive mechanisms can AI better align with human ways of thinking and achieve genuine human–machine understanding.
- **Intelligence**: Only by enhancing the overall performance of reasoning and perception can AI demonstrate efficient and flexible abilities in complex and dynamic environments, better serving human needs.
