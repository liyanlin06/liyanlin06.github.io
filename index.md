## About Me

Greetings and thanks for visiting my homepage. 

My name is Yanlin Li. I am a Master of Computing (Artificial Intelligence specialization) student at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) from August 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Mong-Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and [Prof. Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and [Dr. Hao Fei](https://haofei.vip/). Before that, I have obtained the Bachelor of Software Engineering at the [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China.

I am actively looking for <font color='red'>Ph.D</font> position in 2026 Fall or 2027 Spring. I am eager to explore novel areas of research (current attempts are to define future directions) and I am also willing to seek some external collaborations. Contact me if you have any leads! Deeply obliged.

## Research Interests


I believe that the development of technology should always be human-centered, and my long-term research goal is to build **Human-Centered AGI**.

To advance this vision, I focus on three interconnected aspects:

- **Interaction**: Only with natural and intuitive multimodal interaction can AI truly align with human habits, providing personalized and collaborative experiences.
- **Cognition**: Only by understanding and simulating human cognitive mechanisms can AI better align with human ways of thinking and achieve genuine human–machine understanding.
- **Intelligence**: Only by enhancing the overall performance of reasoning and perception can AI demonstrate efficient and flexible abilities in complex and dynamic environments, better serving human needs.
